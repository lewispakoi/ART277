    <h2>Traveling In Depression</h2>
    <div style="text-align:left; margin: top 0; margin: left 10%;  margin-right: 5%; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">
        <p>  When I was very little, I caught the travel bug. It started after my grandparents first brought  me to their home in France and I have now been to twenty-nine different countries. Each has  given me a unique learning experience. </p>

        <p>At five, I marveled at the Eiffel Tower in the City of Lights. When I was eight, I stood in the  heart of Piazza San Marco feeding hordes of pigeons, then glided down Venetian waterways  on sleek gondolas. At thirteen, I saw the ancient, megalithic structure of Stonehenge and  walked along the Great Wall of China, amazed that the  
        thousand-year-old stones were still in place. 
        It was through exploring cultures around the world that I first  
        became interested in language. 
        It began with French, which taught me the importance of  
        pronunciation. I remember once asking a store owner in Paris  
        where Rue des Pyramides was. But when I pronounced it  
        PYR–a–mides instead of pyr–A–mides, with more accent on  
        the A, she looked at me bewildered. 
        In the eighth grade, I became fascinated with Spanish and  
        aware of its similarities with English through cognates.  
        Baseball in Spanish, for example, is béisbol, which looks  
        different but sounds nearly the same. This was incredible to  
        me as it made speech and comprehension more fluid, and even today I find that cognates  come to the rescue when I forget how to say something in Spanish. 
        Then, in high school, I developed an enthusiasm for Chinese. As I studied Chinese at my  school, I marveled how if just one stroke was missing from a character, the meaning is lost. I 
        loved how long words were formed by combining simpler characters, so Huǒ (火) meaning  fire and Shān (山) meaning mountain can be joined to create Huǒshān (火山), which means  volcano. I love spending hours at a time practicing the characters and I can feel the beauty  and rhythm as I form them.
