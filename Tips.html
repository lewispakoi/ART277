<h4>“Fully vaccinated” doesn’t mean “immune to COVID-19” </h4>
<p>
As restrictions and mask mandates are dropped around the county, people who are fully 
vaccinated might be feeling the return-to-normal fantasy. But Dr. Cardona warns that now still 
isn’t the time to let your guard down. While the vaccines are potent, there’s still a chance that 
you could become infected. <br>
<br>
Dr. Cardona explains. <br>
<br>
“‘Fully vaccinated’ means that you completed a COVID-19 vaccine series as recommended for 
the best protection against severe complications such as hospitalizations and/or death. No 
vaccine offers 100% protection against illness, yet it does give you a better chance to fight off 
the infectious consequences of being exposed to the SARS-CoV2 virus.” 
<br>
<h4>Can fully vaccinated people still transmit the virus to 
others, including other vaccinated people? </h4>
While it is possible, Dr. Cardona says that the ability to transmit COVID-19 may occur at a lower 
rate. She adds that this could also be a reality for people who don’t have a good immune 
response to vaccines. 
“The elderly, those with immune or chronic health conditions or those with underlying health 
disorders may not have the best protective response to vaccines, such as the COVID-19 
vaccines. We are still collecting data and doing ongoing research about the vaccine responses in 
these vulnerable populations.”
