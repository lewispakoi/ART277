                It’s almost like we need a strong dose of something to knock out all of the misinformation. But 
                despite all the myths and urban legends, about half of the U.S. population is fully vaccinated. <br>

                So, what do vaccinated people need to do to stay safe? And is it still possible for them to spread 
                COVID-19 to others? Infectious disease specialist <a href="www.lyssettecardona.com">Lyssette Cardona</a>, MD, answers those 
                questions and covers why vaccination is still one of our best weapons in the fight against 
                COVID-19.<br>

                Well, not to some. Vaccinated people are up against a 
                new set of myths — they’re literally magnetic or 
                they’re going to shed vaccine components and alter 
                the DNA of unvaccinated people. And despite the extra 
                layer of protection, they still have to grapple with the 
                same pandemic realities as everyone else</p>
